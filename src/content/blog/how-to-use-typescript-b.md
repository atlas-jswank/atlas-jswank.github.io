In the last post we talked about the benefits of typesript and how its possible to use typescript without any special syntax or compilation steps. But using typescript without the compiler can be limiting. In this post we will go over how to fully advantage of the benefits of typescript.

### Setting up Typescript

Tools like vite and nextjs will automatically install and configure typescript for you but its good to understand how to do it manually.

#### Installing Typescript

To install typescript you can use the following command in your project:

```bash
npm install -D typescript
```

To configure the typescript compiler you need a `tsconfig.json` file. This file holds the settings for configuring the compiler. To generate a default `tsconfig.json` file run:

```bash
npx tsc --init 
```

#### Compiling Typescript to Javascript

To compile typescript to javascript you can use the following command:

```bash
npx tsc src/*.ts
```

You can now run the compiled javascript files with node:

```bash
node src/index.js
```

#### Configuring Typescript Compiler

There are a lot of possible options for configuring the typescript compiler. It can be overwhelming to figure out what is best for your project. Here are some of the most common options:

* In the `tsconfig.json` add `"include": ["src/**/*.ts"]`. Now you no longer need to tell the compiler which files to compile. It will compile all `.ts` files in the `src` folder. Run `npx tsc` to verify this is working. 
* In the `tsconfig.json` under `"compilerOptions"` add `"outDir": "./dist"` . This will output all compiled javascript files in the `dist` folder when you run npx tsc. This keeps the source code you write separate from the compiled code generated by the compiler. Run `npx tsc` to verify the output is generating in the `dist` folder.
* Now run the compiled code with `node dist/index.js`. The javascript file should execute without error.

#### Type Declaration Files

When writing typescript in `.ts` files you have your code and types in one file. When you compile your code to javascript the types are stripped out leaving only the runnable code. The down side to this is you lose the type information. To preserve the types after the code is compiled you need to output type declaration files.

In the `tsconfig.json` under `"compilerOptions"` add `"declaration": true`. Run `npx tsc` and verify there are `.d.ts` files in the `dist` folder. These are files that only contain type information.
To summarize:

* `.js` files contains only code, no types.
* `.d.ts` only contain types, no code.
* `.ts` files contain code and types.

#### Running typescript without compiling first

Up until this point running typescript has been a two step process:
* Compile the code with `npx tsc`
* Run the code with `node dist/index.js`

You can combine the two steps with `tsx`
* Install `tsx` with `npm install -D tsx`
* Run the typescript file with `npx tsx src/index.ts`. You should see the same output as before with no errors.

### Primitive Types

In TypeScript, primitive types are the most basic data types that represent simple values. They are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after they are created. The main primitive types in TypeScript include:

A `number` represents both integer and floating-point numbers. Here, `age` and `price` are both of the number type.


```tsx
let age: number = 25;
let price: number = 19.99;
```

A `string` represents a sequence of characters, used for textual data.

```tsx
let name: string = "Alice";
let greeting: string = `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

A `boolean` represents a logical value that can be either true or false.


```tsx
let isRaining: boolean = true;
let isSunny: boolean = false;
```

A `null` represents the intentional absence of any object value. `selectedItem` is declared as a string that can also be null, indicating that no item has been selected.

```tsx
let selectedItem: string | null = null;
```

An `undefined` represents an uninitialized variable or missing property. `optionalName` is defined as a string that could also be undefined, meaning it hasn't been assigned a value yet. null and undefined are different from each other, but they are both values that can be used to represent the absence of a value.

```tsx
let optionalName: string | undefined = undefined;
```

These primitive types form the building blocks for more complex data structures in TypeScript. Understanding them is essential for working effectively with the language.

### Function Types

In TypeScript, typing functions is a powerful feature that enhances code readability and maintainability by enforcing the types of input parameters and the return type. This ensures that functions are used as intended and helps prevent common programming errors.

**Basic Function with Typed Parameters and Return Type**

```tsx
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
}
```

Here, the `add` function expects two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of type number, and it also returns `a` number.

**Function with No Return Value**

```tsx
function log(message: string): void {
    console.log(message);
}
```

The log function accepts a string parameter and does not return a value, hence the return type is void.

**Optional Parameters**

```tsx
function greet(name: string, date?: Date): string {
    if (date) {
        return `Hello, ${name}! Today is ${date.toDateString()}.`;
    } else {
        return `Hello, ${name}!`;
    }
}
```

The greet function takes a mandatory `string` parameter `name` and an optional `Date` parameter `date`. It returns a `string`.

**Function with Default Parameters**

```tsx
function buildUrl(base: string, path: string = '/'): string {
    return `${base}${path}`;
}
```

The `buildUrl` function takes a `string` parameter `base` and an optional parameter `path` with a default value of `'/'`. It returns a string.

**Function Type for Variable**

Functions can be assigned to variables, and you can define the function type explicitly.

```tsx
let compute: (x: number, y: number) => number;
compute = function(x, y) { return x + y; };
```

### Object Types

Type aliases in TypeScript are a powerful feature that allows you to create a new name for a type. Type aliases are especially useful when you want to simplify complex type definitions or when you need to reuse the same type across your codebase without repeating it.

Type aliases are created using the `type` keyword followed by the alias name and the type definition. Once defined, the alias can be used anywhere a type can be used.

**Simple Type Alias for an Object**

You can define a type alias for an object type to make object structures easier to manage and reuse.

```tsx
type User = {
    id: number;
    username: string;
    isActive: boolean;
};

let user: User = {
    id: 1,
    username: "john_doe",
    isActive: true
};

```

Here, User is a type alias for an object structure that describes a user. This makes it easy to specify that a variable should have this particular structure without rewriting the object type every time.

**Type Alias with Optional Properties**

Type aliases can include optional properties using the ? symbol.

```tsx
type Product = {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    price: number;
    description?: string; // Optional property
};

let product: Product = {
    id: 100,
    name: "Desk Lamp",
    price: 29.99
    // 'description' is optional
};
```

In this example, the `description` property is optional, so `product` objects may or may not include it.

**Type Alias for Complex Structures**

Type aliases can also be used for more complex structures, including objects with methods or nested objects.

```tsx
type Contact = {
    name: string;
    email: string;
    address: {
        street: string;
        city: string;
        zipCode: string;
    };
    sendMessage: (message: string) => void;
};

let contact: Contact = {
    name: "Alice Johnson",
    email: "alice@example.com",
    address: {
        street: "123 Maple St",
        city: "Springfield",
        zipCode: "12345"
    },
    sendMessage: function(message) {
        console.log(`Sending message to ${this.email}: ${message}`);
    }
};

contact.sendMessage("Hello, Alice!");
```

This example shows a Contact type with nested object properties and a method, demonstrating how type aliases can encapsulate complex behaviors and structures.

**Type Alias for Functions**

Type aliases can also be used for functions. This allows you to define a function type with a specific return type and parameter types.

```tsx
type Point = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};

// Takes input variable of type "Point"
function printPoint(point: Point) {
  console.log(`The point is at ${point.x}, ${point.y}`);
}

// Return value has the shape of Point
function generateRandomPoint(): Point {
  return {
    x: Math.random() * 100,
    y: Math.random() * 100,
  };
}
```

### Unions and Intersections

In TypeScript, unions and intersections are powerful features that allow you to combine types in flexible ways, catering to various scenarios in type definition. They provide a way to handle variables and functions that can operate on more than one type of data.

A union type is a way to declare a variable that can hold values of different types. It is defined using the `|` operator, and it signifies that a variable can be any one of several types.

**Basic Union Type**

```tsx
type StringOrNumber = string | number;
let identifier: StringOrNumber;

identifier = '123';  // Valid
identifier = 123;    // Also valid
```

Here, `identifier` can be either a `string` or a `number`.

**Union of Object Types**

```tsx
type Circle = {
  kind: "circle";
  radius: number;
};
type Square = {
  kind: "square";
  sideLength: number;
};

type Shape = Circle | Square;

function getArea(shape: Shape): number {
  if (shape.kind === "circle") {
    return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
  } else {
    return shape.sideLength ** 2;
  }
}
```

`Shape` is a union type that can be either a `Circle` or a `Square`, and the function `getArea` calculates the area based on the kind of shape.

An intersection type combines multiple types into one. It is defined using the & operator, meaning the resulting type will have all properties of all constituent types.

**Basic Intersection**

```tsx
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

type Employee = {
  companyId: string;
};

type EmployeeUser = User & Employee;

let eu: EmployeeUser = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 28,
  companyId: "12345"
};
```

`EmployeeUser` is an intersection type that includes all properties from both `User` and `Employee`.


**Using Intersection to Enhance Functionality**

```tsx
type Point = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};

type Point3D = Point & {
  z: number;
};

let point3D: Point3D = {
  x: 1,
  y: 2,
  z: 3
};
```

`Point3D` combines properties from `Point` with an additional `z` coordinate.



**To recap:**

* **Unions:** Useful when a value can be one of several types. They are often used in scenarios where a function needs to handle inputs of multiple types.
* **Intersections:** Useful for combining multiple existing types or enhancing a type with additional properties. They are particularly handy in mixin patterns or to enforce a combination of behaviors.

### Null and Undefined

In TypeScript, `null` and `undefined` are two primitive types that each represent the absence of a value, but they are used in slightly different contexts. Understanding these types is crucial for managing the absence of data effectively and avoiding common bugs related to uninitialized variables or missing values.

**Examples of null:**

```tsx
let firstName: string = "John";
firstName = null; //error, firstName is not nullable

let lastName: string | null = "Smith";
lastName = null; //ok
```

**Example of undefined:**

```tsx
function calculate(): number | undefined {
  // Simulate a function that does not always assign a value
  if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
    return 42;
  }
  //  undefined is returned if random is less than 0.5
}

```

The key difference is `null` is an explicit value you can assign to a variable to represent "no value". `undefined` is the default state of a variable that has not been assigned any value since it was declared. Javascript initializes variables as `undefined` by default. `null` needs to be explicitly assigned. TypeScript respects these semantics by default. Typescript is a null safe language. That means by default variables cannot be null or undefined unless you explicitly declare them as such.

You can define variables, parameters, and return types as nullable (able to hold `null` or `undefined`) or non-nullable, thereby making your intent clear and your program's behavior more predictable.

```tsx
function process(data: string | null | undefined) {
  if (data === null || data === undefined) {
    console.log("No data provided.");
  } else {
    console.log(`Processing: ${data}`);
  }
}
```

Understanding the differences and appropriate uses of null and undefined is vital for writing robust TypeScript programs, especially in managing and validating data presence and state within applications.

### Async and Promises

In TypeScript, as in JavaScript, Promise and async functions are fundamental concepts for handling asynchronous operations. They allow you to work with asynchronous code in a way that is cleaner and easier to reason about compared to traditional callback-based approaches.

`async` functions simplify the behavior of using promises and allow you to handle asynchronous operations more synchronously, or in a more linear fashion. When you declare a function as `async`, it implicitly returns a `Promise`.

```tsx
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

async function fetchData(): Promise<User> {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
}
```
In this example, `fetchData` is an `async` function that fetches data from a URL and returns it as JSON. The await keyword is used to pause the execution of the function until the promise settles, and it makes the asynchronous code look and behave a bit more like synchronous code. While `data` is a type `User` because the function contains the `async` keyword, the return type of the function is `Promise<User>`.
